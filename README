JAVA ALGORITHMS

The Java algorithms project has two primary purposes.  First, the project
is an exercise for me (and whoever decides to join in on the endeavour) to
learn or relearn the right way to think about and implement all those
classic computer science algorithms.  Second, hopefully the code that
comes out the project will be helpful to students and professionals who
are looking for no-nonsense, well-documented, efficient, and generic
implementations of some classic sorting and searching algorithms.
